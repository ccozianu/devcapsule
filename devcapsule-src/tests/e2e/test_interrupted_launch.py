"""Ctrl+C ends a real session with a result and the log paths, not a traceback.

Opt-in with the IDE smoke (``nox -s ide-smoke``; the ``ide_smoke`` marker):
a fresh project for the lightest surface is launched exactly as an adopter
holds ``project run``, in its own process group, and once the desktop
answers the group receives SIGINT the way a terminal delivers Ctrl+C. The
launcher must announce the interrupt, wait for the capsule, print one result
line and every session log file on this computer, and exit 130; the
container must be gone; and the IDE's own output must be in its file, not
in the launcher's terminal output. The two C10 records of 2026-10-22.
