"""The recursive successor is launched attached, from a fresh workspace, and leaves nothing behind.

Runs only inside a DevCapsule capsule with host-Docker access (the
``recursive_e2e`` marker). The test first makes itself a fresh workspace
(``fresh_workspace.py``): it refuses a dirty source, clones this
repository's HEAD into an owned run directory under the persistent home,
answers the clone's configuration as this capsule's own checkout was
answered, and resolves it under configuration roots isolated beneath the
run directory. The capsule's own checkout records are never read or
written; the 2026-10-04 record explains why that matters.

It then drives ``launch-successor`` on the clone exactly as a developer
holds ``project run``: it starts the command as a subprocess, waits until
the run manifest says the successor is running, inspects it independently,
stops the container, waits for the command to return, and proves that
Docker removed the container and the run directory kept the evidence. At
the end it removes the workspace, best effort.
