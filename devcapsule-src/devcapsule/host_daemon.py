"""Make ordinary launches aware that they may be running inside a container.

A DevCapsule launch normally runs on the host, where a bind source written by
the launcher means the same thing to the Docker daemon as it does to the
launching process. That assumption breaks when the launcher itself runs inside
a container whose Docker CLI is pointed at the *host* daemon: the daemon
resolves bind sources in the host filesystem, where the launcher's own paths do
not exist.

Docker does not report that as an error. It creates a missing bind source as an
empty directory, so an IDE launched this way silently opens an empty project
instead of the developer's code.

This module detects that situation and translates each bind source through the
current container's own mount table, so the daemon receives the host path that
actually backs it. When a bind source is not backed by any mount, translation
is impossible and the launch fails loudly rather than silently producing an
empty directory.
