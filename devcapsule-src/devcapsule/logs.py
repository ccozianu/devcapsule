"""Session logs: one file per component, a WARNING baseline, a lifecycle record.

Every critical component of a DevCapsule session writes its own log file,
recognizable by name, ``devcapsule-<component>.log``, in one directory per
session that the launcher creates on the host and binds into the capsule
(see ``engineering-docs/work-orders/2026-10-08-persistent-session-diagnostics.md``).
The launcher and the supervisor are Python and log through :mod:`logging`.
A child process without a severity interface of its own (a window manager, a
panel, a bridge, an IDE's standard streams) is *teed*: the supervisor copies
its output line by line into the child's file while the console keeps seeing
it unchanged.

Two levels are in play:

- The baseline is WARNING, the equivalent of slf4j's WARN. The verbosity
  override ``DEVCAPSULE_LOG_LEVEL`` lowers it for an investigation.
- Lifecycle events (a child starts, is ready, exits, is signalled; a session
  begins and ends) are recorded at INFO whatever the baseline, through
  :func:`events_logger`, because they are what reconstructs an incident.

Every writer rotates its own file, in process, the moment a write would
carry it past its segment (:class:`SegmentedFile`): the live file is
compressed to ``.1.gz``, the older segments shift up and the one
beyond the count is removed. No external rotator, no polling, no window in
which output lands in a rotated segment, and no base image requirement.
``DEVCAPSULE_LOG_BUDGET`` sets a retention target for the checkout, not a
hard disk quota: the launcher derives each file's segment size from it and
removes the oldest ended sessions beyond it at the next launch.

Writing a log must never take the session down: every failure here degrades
to the console with one line saying what was lost.
