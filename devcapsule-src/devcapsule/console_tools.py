"""The web console's command-line tools, run from the runtime CLI inside a capsule.

The console is a separate process and package from the runtime, installed in
the base image under ``/opt/devcapsule-webconsole`` and, under the
self-hosting exception, mounted from the checkout as the runtime plan's
``console.source_path``. Its ``decisions`` module builds, checks and hands
off decision documents. This module locates that interpreter and that
source, so ``project checkout decisions`` runs the same module an agent
would otherwise have to find by path.
