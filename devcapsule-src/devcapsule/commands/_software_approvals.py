"""The launch-time offer of software approvals, and the prompt it shares with bulk authorization.

``project run`` asks before anything else whether the pending decisions are
software approvals only (``devcapsule.configuration.approvals``). If they
are, the list is shown and one key approves it, the answers are written to
the checkout record and the resolution is regenerated, and the launch goes
on. Any other key, or no terminal, ends the launch with the command that
approves later and the guide's address. Nothing is written on a refusal.
