"""The truthful listing: every choice of a checkout with its effective value, its source and what is pending.

Principle 6 of the CLI UX redesign work order of 2026-10-24: a listing shows
the value the next launch uses, where it comes from, and whether a decision
is pending; a missing answer is a row, not a refusal, and the listing never
writes anything.  ``config show`` prints it, ``config check`` exits 3 on its
pending rows, the web console renders it.

Every row is one of these kinds:

- ``ide``, ``agent``, ``tool``: the capabilities of the checkout, from the
  project's requirements and offers and the checkout's selection;
- ``memory``, ``cpus``: the launcher-owned values, from the checkout, the
  project's recommendation or the workstation's defaults;
- ``access``: host access and the base and vendor consents, from the
  authorization review;
- ``env``: the environment the project asks for and the checkout saved;
- ``value``, ``binding``, ``secret``: the project's declared values and the
  selected components' state slots and secret inputs.

The sources are plain words: ``checkout``, ``project (required)``,
``project (offered)``, ``project recommendation``, ``workstation default``,
``secure default``, ``none``.  A pending row carries the one command that
settles it.

This module is pure: the adapters load the documents and pass them in,
with the launcher catalog's view of which capability is an IDE or an agent
and which component supplies it.
