"""The project manifest's two schemas, each as a class, and the one migration between them.

A manifest, ``.devcapsule/devcapsule.toml``, says which schema it is written
in with ``devcapsule-schema-version``.  This module is the only place that
says what each schema may contain and how a schema-1 file becomes schema 2:

* :class:`ManifestV1` is the file as launchers before 0.3.0 rc4 wrote it.
  Its capabilities come in one of two forms, ``need`` (one list, the IDE
  among the names) or ``required``/``optional`` as rc3 wrote them. Either
  may stand beside a retired ``sdk-major`` table. The root key ``workflow-type`` may
  stand beside ``[workflow]``.  It has no environment declarations and no
  recommendations: those are schema-2 words, and a file that uses them says 2.
* :class:`ManifestV2` is the file as the one writer, ``render_manifest``,
  writes it since rc4: ``required`` with minimums and ``optional``, the
  owner's reasons, the environment the project asks for, the ordinary
  recommendations (the IDE, memory, CPUs).  It has no ``need`` list.  A
  root ``workflow-type``, which the writers of rc4 to rc7 carried over from
  schema-1 files, is folded into ``[workflow].mode`` on reading and never
  written again.
* :func:`read_manifest` admits a decoded file as the class its version names.
* :func:`upgrade` turns a V1 into a V2 in memory, by the laws its docstring
  states.  Writing the result is the caller's act: an owner's edit or
  ``project init --regenerate``; no other command rewrites a schema-1 file
  (R-CONFIG-001, decision 19 of the CLI UX order).

Apart from the carried-over ``workflow-type`` above, each class refuses the
other schema's words and tolerates what neither schema names: unknown root tables and unknown keys under
``[capabilities]`` are carried as extensions, so an edit by this launcher
never drops a newer owner's field.  The retired ``sdk-major`` table is
tolerated on both, carried in memory so ``capability_notes`` can say it is
ignored, and dropped by the writer.

The module is pure and knows no catalog.  The one catalog question the
migration asks, which names are IDE capabilities, is the ``ide`` function
the caller passes to :func:`upgrade`.
