"""Offline generation and tolerant consumption of capability locks.

Shared bytes are never changed by consumption. Two steps are kept apart:
``compose_lock`` builds the persistent selection (shared lock plus personal
pins, or an explicit version set) and ``usable_lock`` projects it for one
execution, checking mandatory providers first and admitting optional provider
closures only as whole units. Only the projection applies omissions, so a
persisted selection never loses what an omission merely hides.
