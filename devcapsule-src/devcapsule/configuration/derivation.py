"""Derive one checkout's launch plan from its documents: the resolve step, done by ``run``.

Answer 1 of the CLI UX redesign work order of 2026-10-24 and its principle
3: ``project run`` is the first-contact command and the return-to-work
command. It reads the project's manifest and lock, the home's
defaults and the checkout's record, derives the plan, asks only what it
cannot derive, and launches. Nothing derived is the user's to refresh:
the generated resolution is written here, every time, as the launch's own
artifact.

This module is the adapter between the documents on disk and the
in-memory :class:`Configuration`: it registers a checkout that has no record
yet, composes the checkout's selection (with a run-once IDE or agent laid
over it when asked), derives and writes the resolution, and hands the
launch a :class:`ResolvedProject`. Asking the developer is the command's
job; the structured decisions come from the listing.
