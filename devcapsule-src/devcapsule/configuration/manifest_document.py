"""The project manifest as a document: its schema versions, the owner's vocabulary, and the one writer.

The manifest, ``.devcapsule/devcapsule.toml``, is read in code review by
every collaborator, so it is written in the form an owner would write by
hand (the CLI UX redesign work order of 2026-10-24, decision 11): bare keys
wherever TOML allows them, tables in a fixed owner-friendly order, a leading
comment block kept across rewrites, nothing derived in it.  Schema version 2
(decision 19) adds the vocabulary of decision 9: the environment a project
requires or offers, each name with the owner's reason, and the project's
recommendations for the IDE, the memory limit and the CPU count, which the
launcher applies as defaults and discloses, never asks (decision 24).

Readers stay tolerant (R-CONFIG-001): a schema-1 manifest, with the legacy
``capabilities.need`` form or the ``required``/``optional`` form, is read as
it is and never rewritten by a command that does not edit it.  Only an owner's
edit writes the file, and every owner's edit writes schema 2.

This module is pure: it validates and renders mappings.  Validation against
the launcher's catalog (is ``frontend-ide`` an IDE?) belongs to the adapters
that know the catalog; file IO belongs to storage and the command adapters.
