"""Checkout-facing operations: one function per user-visible operation.

Command modules translate parsed arguments into exactly one call here and
print the returned report; policy, validation, and artifact writes live on
this side of the boundary.  This is the operation layer the first-run design
requires: the write half and the read half of each artifact contract sit in
the same module instead of being split between a command callback and a
library loader.

Reports render themselves (`render()`), so the exact user-facing wording of
an operation's outcome is owned here alongside the operation, not composed
ad hoc at each call site.
