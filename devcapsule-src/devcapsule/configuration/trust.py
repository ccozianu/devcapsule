"""The home's trust record: vendors and channels accepted once per configuration home, for every project.

D-0011 (2026-10-01), as the owner refined it for 0.3.0 rc4 (answer 3 of
the CLI UX redesign work order): the user accepts a vendor's terms and
trusts its channel once per home, "in all its versions and
incarnations", not per project, checkout or version. A channel is a vendor,
an origin and an integrity method: DevCapsule's own base images from
``docker.io/mycodespaceai/devcapsule-base``, content-addressed by the
digest the launcher pins; each vendor product from the origins its locked
artifacts name, verified by the pinned SHA-256. Anything resolved through
an accepted channel is approved without a question; anything that leaves
it asks: a local image, a different origin, changed terms.

The record lives under the launcher's config root, in ``settings.toml`` under ``trust``, beside
the checkout records; it is the user's, never the project's. Older clients
never read it and keep their per-checkout consents, which remain honored.

This module is pure: it defines channels from a lock and reads and renders
the record. Reading and writing the file belongs to :mod:`storage`.
