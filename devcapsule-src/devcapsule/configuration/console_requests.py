"""The console's deferred requests: widenings asked on the console, kept until the user confirms them on the host.

The contract and the classification are :mod:`console_channel`. A deferred
request lives in a ``requests.json`` keyed by the checkout's canonical path
and project identity, independently of its registration name, under the launcher's
config root, in a tree beside the Docker-arguments files so the mounted
records directory never exposes it. Each is a pending, soft decision of the
checkout's listing: ``run`` asks it at the terminal, ``config show`` lists
it with the confirming command, ``config console`` applies or discards it.
