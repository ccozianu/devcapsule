"""Software approvals: new versions of vendor software the developer approved before.

A vendor download is consented to per pinned version (the acquisition
consent of ``authorization.py``), so a lock change that brings a new version
of an agent the developer already approved asks again, once per component.
Typically that lock change arrives with a sync of the project from its
remote, and the developer has nothing new to decide: the vendor and its terms
are those of the earlier consent. The owner's direction of 2026-10-22: when
the only pending decisions are of that kind, ``project run`` offers them as
one list to approve with one answer, and ``project config approve`` records
the same approvals from the command line.

What qualifies is strict. Every pending decision must be an acquisition
consent whose recorded answer is yes and whose recommendation changed; the
component must be in the lock under the contract its code declares, so the
vendor and the terms URL are the earlier consent's. A missing consent, a
denial, a host-access decision or a base decision in the list means the
list is not a software approval: those are decided one by one, as before.
