"""The resolution matrix: capability needs × platform → a verified formation.

The user expresses capability needs; this module looks up component versions
that satisfy those needs on a platform, constrained by what has been tested
(D-0007). Verification is a fact about a combination and does not expire:
the matrix accumulates **verified edges** — (component version, base
version, platform) with the evidence that verified them — plus **declared
couplings** for component pairs with an integration surface, which need
jointly verified version pairs. Components without a declared coupling
compose freely on a shared verified base (default orthogonality). New
releases append rows; removal is explicit retirement, never an implicit
effect of newer versions arriving.

Resolution selects the newest verified combination and is a pure offline
derivation: same need, same matrix ⇒ identical lock bytes. It needs no
network and never probes the container daemon, because the daemon is
exactly the capability that requires explicit authorization.

The generated lock follows the scoped-digest principle: it records a digest
of exactly the inputs it derives from — the normalized capability set — and
nothing more. The recorded ``resolution-matrix-version`` is informational
per ``R-COMPAT-001``: a newer client's matrix changes what would be
*generated next time*, never the validity of a lock that stands.

The public surface is deliberately minimal (Parnas): ``MATRICES`` keyed by
``Platform``, ``ResolutionMatrix`` with ``capabilities``/``normalize``/
``resolve``, the ``Formation`` a resolution returns, and
``ResolutionError``. Everything else — the capability taxonomy, the pins,
the selection policy, the evidence, the lock rendering — is this module's
secret.
