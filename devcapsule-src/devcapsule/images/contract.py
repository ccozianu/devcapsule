"""What a base image promises, kept apart from who built it.

A base image is a prebuilt OCI image that every capsule image names in its
``FROM`` line. Its consumers, the formation built on it and the components
validated to run there, rely on a set of promises: an operating-system line
and its library ABI, the toolchains present and where they live, whether a
contained display is available, and what the runtime expects of the image.
Those promises are the base's *contract*, and the recipe in ``base_image``
is the contract's text. The release of the tool that happened to execute
the recipe is provenance, recorded and shown, never the base's identity.

Compatibility follows the ordinary API rule. A recipe may add services and
stay in its *family*; a consumer validated on an older recipe of the family
still runs on a newer one. Removing or replacing a service, changing the OS
line, or requiring a runtime vocabulary older launchers cannot execute opens
a new family, and nothing validated on the old family carries over. D-0007
already validates component versions per family; this module names the rule
the matrix applies.
