# The DevCapsule Development Blog

Entries about developing DevCapsule that are worth a wider audience than
the engineering records: how a decision was reached, what a bug taught,
how a human and an agent divide the work. The product owner opened this
folder on 2026-09-06 with the view that the development of DevCapsule is
an exercise as valuable as the software itself.

For the simple file conventions, see
[Blog Entries in the local workflow](../../WORKFLOW-LOCAL.md#blog-entries).

Every entry begins with a YAML front matter block carrying `description`,
one sentence of at most 200 characters that the website shows as the
entry's summary, and `draft: true` while the owner has not released it;
a draft is excluded from production builds and shown labelled in preview.
Nothing else framework-specific belongs in an entry. The block is authored
here, per [R-DOCS-003](../requirements/product/r-docs-003-website-content-carries-front-matter.md).

## House style

An entry is written for a reader, not for the record. Five rules, from the
competitive comparison of 2026-10-18, whose first copy opened with twenty
lines of provenance:

1. The first screen says what the reader gets: a lede of at most two
   sentences, and a **TL;DR** when the entry is long.
2. Provenance, method, versions and status go at the end, in a closing
   *About this entry* section. Nothing of that kind sits above the fold.
3. The entry is written in a person's voice. The controlled-language rule
   of the workflow applies to records, not here.
4. The agent drafts and the owner edits. An entry is not released until
   the owner has made that pass; `draft: true` until then.
5. A copy of an engineering record is a draft, not an entry. Restructure it
   for the reader first, and offer the cuts rather than copying the whole.
