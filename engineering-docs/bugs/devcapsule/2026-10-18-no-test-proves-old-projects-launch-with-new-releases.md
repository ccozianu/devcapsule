# No test proves that projects initialized by an earlier release keep launching with a new one

## Symptom

The unit suite had one test that read this repository's own lock,
`test_resolution_reconstitutes_the_dogfood_environment`, and it asserted the
wrong thing: that the committed lock equals the matrix's newest selection.
That is repository housekeeping, not a behaviour of the code, and since the
2026-10-05 rule only a launcher command on the host may do that housekeeping.
The test went red on `main` and on `release-0.3.0` on 2026-10-18 when the
agent pins advanced (PR #224, PR #228), blocked the candidate workflow, and
told nobody anything about whether an older project still launches. Deleted
on 2026-10-18 and replaced by
`test_repository_lock_is_launchable_by_this_launcher`, which reads the
committed lock the way `project run` does and asserts it parses into a
launchable environment.

That replacement proves one lock, ours, written one matrix generation ago.
The contract the owner wants enforced is wider: every project that an
earlier release initialized, its manifest, its platform lock and its
checkout record, must keep launching with a new release. *Keep The
Development Checkout Launchable* in `WORKFLOW-LOCAL.md` and R-CONFIG-001
state the rule, be liberal in what we accept; nothing exercises it across
releases. The 2026-09-24 incident, released launchers rejecting the
repository manifest, and the 2026-10-04 incident, an unreleased Playwright
entry breaking the checkout launch, were both of this class and were both
found by people.

## Expected behaviour

A test, in the unit suite or the integration gate, that holds a
configuration captured from each released client still in support, today
v0.2.14 and v0.2.15: the manifest, the platform lock and the checkout record
a `project init` of that release wrote for a representative need. For each
captured configuration, the development code must: read the manifest and
validate it; parse the lock into a launchable environment, every artifact
declaration validated and every runtime template found; read the checkout
record and the authorizations; and resolve the manifest's need against the
development matrix without `--unverified`. A capture is added when a final
release ships and retired when the version leaves support.

## Close criteria

- The captured configurations live under `tests/resources/` with the
  release and the commit they came from in a README.
- The test fails when a reader, a vocabulary or a validator stops accepting
  one of them, naming the release and the file.
- The release runbook names the capture as a step after the final tag.

## Disposition

Opened 2026-10-18 by `maintenance` at the owner's direction, during the
0.3.0 cycle. No target: it is validation work for the next planning, not a
0.3.0 gate.
