# Workstream Current Status: Sample Demo Projects

Mnemonic: `sample-projects`

Start date: 2026-08-14

State: active

Integration target: `main`

Requirements: `R-PRODUCT-002`, `R-SCOPE-001`

## Goal

Provide a small set of realistic sample projects, each carried as a Git
submodule under `devcapsule-src/tests/resources/sample_projects/`, that a
developer can open and run inside DevCapsule. The samples exist to exercise and
demonstrate ordinary adopter workflows rather than DevCapsule's own recursive
self-test, and to surface missing product features from real use.

## Branch Association

The active branch is `sample-projects/fastapi-webapp`, forked from the `main`
registration commit for this workstream.

## Delivery Method

Each sample project is an independent public repository added as a submodule.
The parent repository records only the submodule pointer and `.gitmodules`
entry; sample source history belongs to the sample repository.

The first sample uses remote
`git@github.com:ccozianu/devcapsule-sample-fastapi-webbapp`, provisioned by the
product owner. Note the doubled `b` in `webbapp`; it is the actual repository
name, not a typo in this record.

## Current State

- The workstream is registered and its first branch is associated.
- No sample project has been completed yet.

## Last Task And Status

Last task: register the workstream and begin the first sample project.

Status: in progress.

## Planned Samples

1. `fastapi-webapp` (first): FastAPI backend, React single-page frontend,
   PostgreSQL persistence, PyCharm as the interactive surface, and Claude Code
   enabled. Ships a small TODO application, `.devcapsule/` project declaration
   and lock, and a `developer-readme.md` explaining how to start development
   inside DevCapsule.

Further samples are deliberately unspecified until the first one proves the
shape.

## Next Resumable Task

Complete the `fastapi-webapp` sample.

Done means:

- the sample repository builds and runs its TODO application against
  PostgreSQL inside a DevCapsule environment;
- `.devcapsule/` declares the project, its interactive surface, and the
  components the sample genuinely needs;
- `developer-readme.md` documents first-run setup from a clean clone;
- the submodule pointer and `.gitmodules` entry are committed on this
  workstream branch; and
- repository documentation checks pass.

## Feature-Gap Escalation Rule

If completing a sample requires a DevCapsule capability that does not exist,
pause this workstream and switch to `project-management` to sequence the gap
rather than working around it inside a sample. Record the exact missing
capability, the sample that exposed it, and the workaround considered and
rejected.

## External State And Risks

- Sample repositories are public. No credential, host path, or personal
  configuration may enter their history.
- A sample must not depend on DevCapsule's recursive E2E workspaces, retained
  runs, or engineering-mode commands.
- Adding a submodule makes the parent tree depend on a reachable remote. Until
  a sample remote is published, parent-repository clones cannot initialize that
  submodule.

## Workstream Document Index

This workstream currently owns only this WIP status file.
