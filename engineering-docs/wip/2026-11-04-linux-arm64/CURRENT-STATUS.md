# Workstream Current Status: linux-arm64 Capsules

Mnemonic: `linux-arm64`

Start date: 2026-11-04

State: active; slices 1 to 3 and the review's fixes committed 2026-11-04; native smokes pending Docker

Branch association: `ws-linux-arm64/capsules`, forked from local `main` at b3f10b7d, with
`ws-macos-launcher/host-port` merged in as its foundation

Integration target: `main`, after `macos-launcher`'s pull request

Delivery method: pull request, merge commit; the human opens and merges it

Requirements: R-RUNTIME-001 (the runtime delivered matches the capsule); R-COMPAT-001
(projects locked for `linux-amd64` keep working); R-CONFIG-001

## Goal And Scope

Run capsules as `linux-arm64` as well as `linux-amd64`: natively on Apple Silicon Macs
through the `macos-launcher` work, and on ARM Linux hosts.

In scope, by the human's answers of 2026-11-04:

- every component the `linux-amd64` matrix offers, pinned for `linux-arm64` in one
  workstream: PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, Rider and the .NET SDK, Eclipse and its native
  package closure, VSCodium, VS Code, the Codex, Claude Code and Antigravity CLIs, and
  Playwright;
- an arm64 base image built locally from the existing recipe and approved per checkout as a
  local base; publishing it, and pinning its digest, is the owner's;
- on an Apple Silicon Mac, a project runs as `linux-arm64` when it has a `linux-arm64` lock,
  and otherwise as `linux-amd64` under emulation, as today;
- a `linux-aarch64` runtime executable for arm64 capsules.

Out of scope: publishing images or executables; release automation.

## Current State

**2026-11-04, opened.** The human, running capsules on the Mac under emulation, directed
native ARM capsules: "ok we need linux arm64", then answered four questions: everything at
once; build the base locally now; arm64 when locked, else amd64; a new workstream built on
the macOS branch. Two read-only surveys mapped the work; the plan is in the
[design note](2026-11-04-design-linux-arm64.md).

**2026-11-04, slices 1 to 3.** `Platform.LINUX_ARM64`; a project runs as the first platform
the host runs that it has a lock for, and `project --platform` names one (f1bba6c9,
7a32f1c6). `DEVCAPSULE_RUNTIME_PEX` may name a directory of runtimes. The arm64 base was
built natively here from a launcher at public `main` b3f10b7d and pinned at its local index
digest, unpublished (7a32f1c6). Every component is pinned for arm64 at the amd64 versions,
102 artifacts, 15.6 GB hashed from their bytes (87e71b19), and the Eclipse closure gained
`libunwind8`, which arm64's GStreamer needs (b12e2516). The human's own switch of
`~/hello-devcapsule` to arm64 found that a checkout's personal pins kept the amd64 VSCodium;
personal pins are now re-pinned per platform (52fb1a1a).

Native arm64 smokes on this Mac with the local base: VSCodium passed in 58 s with its main
window; VS Code passed. Eclipse failed at `libunwind8`, since fixed; PyCharm, Rider and
IntelliJ failed on Docker I/O errors when the Mac's disk filled. The disk filled because
these runs built five formations at once on top of a 20 GB artifact cache, and Docker
Desktop's VM failed with it; a restart recovered it. With the human's consent the test
images and build cache were removed, and the reruns go one surface at a time, checking free
space first and removing each image after. The macOS test session now removes its temporary
root; each run had left one in `/tmp`.

Found for `maintenance`, not fixed here: the amd64 Eclipse closure's `libsoup-3.0-0` and
`libsoup-3.0-common` 3.4.4-5ubuntu0.8 URLs return 404, since Ubuntu removed that version from
every noble pocket on 2026-10-08, so Eclipse cannot be acquired afresh on amd64.

**2026-11-04, review and fixes.** The human ran the `/review` skill of `~/work/teachme` on all
changes since `main`, through a separate agent: rejected, seven high, fourteen medium, three
low findings. The human said "fix all"; the design note's section 5 records them, and
section 3 the design they produced. In short: a Mac creates `linux-amd64` projects again and
runs a project as the first platform it has a lock for; the configuration answers which
(`storage.project_platform`), and below it the lock's platform is passed down explicitly; a
delivered runtime must be the launcher's build; the unpublished arm64 base is reported at
init and refused at launch without a local base; Docker Desktop's conventions are `HostOs`
properties; emulation is the daemon's. Unit suite on this Mac: 2,749 passed, 25 skipped.
The human's `~/hello-devcapsule` checkout holds amd64 VSCodium pins labelled arm64, written
by the bug since fixed; re-choosing its IDE through DevCapsule commands repairs it.

**2026-11-04, after the fixes.** A personal pin is remapped when its table is exactly
another platform's embedded pin, whatever its label, so the human's checkout healed without
a command (4d2aeb28): their `~/hello-devcapsule` capsule runs natively, `aarch64`, an arm64
VSCodium. The unit suite in Linux containers: amd64, emulated, 2,770 passed, 4 failed; arm64,
native, 2,757 passed, 17 failed. Both fail three recursive-orchestrator tests that need a host
X11 directory, as `main` does in a headless container now that the skip is Linux-only. The
amd64 run fails a console test whose 0.3 s timeout emulated Python misses; it passes natively.
The arm64 run fails 14 console-channel tests whose real `devcapsule` subprocess sees the
arm64 host while the suite's fixtures are amd64: a limit of the suite on ARM Linux, not CI.
The IDE smoke takes `DEVCAPSULE_SMOKE_PLATFORM` to create its project for a platform.

## Next Resumable Task

Record the rerun smokes; add arm64 verified edges for the surfaces that pass, with their
evidence, so resolution stops needing `--unverified`; then the documentation slice.

## Open Threads

- The SSH agent on this Mac holds no identity, so the workstream cannot be published or
  pushed; registration is local, as is `macos-launcher`'s.
- This branch builds on `ws-macos-launcher/host-port`, which is not yet on `main`. The
  registration commit is forked from `main` as topic 7.5 requires, and the macOS branch is
  merged after it; this pull request follows that one.
- An arm64 base on `docker.io/mycodespaceai`, and its digest in the matrix, need the owner.
  The pin holds the digest a push of this Mac's exact image keeps; a rebuild must re-pin.
- The libsoup 404 on amd64 goes to `maintenance` by intake mail once the coordination branch
  can be pushed.
- Docker access from an arm64 capsule reaches an arm64 daemon either way; on amd64 capsules
  under emulation it also defaults to arm64 images (`docs/platforms/macos.md`).
