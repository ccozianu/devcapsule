# Workstream Current Status: Project Management

Mnemonic: `project-management`

Start date: 2026-08-09

State: active; permanent coordination

Integration target: `main`

Delivery method: pull request

Requirements: `R-PRODUCT-003`, `R-PRODUCT-005`, `R-PRODUCT-006`

## Goal

Provide the durable project-management home for project-wide priorities,
sequencing, cross-workstream dependencies, and lifecycle decisions while this
repository uses the multiple-stream workflow.

This permanent track coordinates other workstreams but does not duplicate
their detailed handoffs, implement their scoped changes, edit their WIP state,
or become a miscellaneous backlog.

## Lifecycle Exception

The user explicitly opened this permanent workstream as a one-off operation
before the general workflow defines it. Unlike ordinary bounded workstreams,
`project-management` remains open while the repository uses
`workflow-type = "multiple-streams"`. The `workflow-improvements` backlog owns
formalizing that exception for all multiple-stream projects, including any
valid retirement or workflow-mode migration procedure.

## Branch Association

The branch is `project-management/coordination`. On 2026-08-18 the product
owner explicitly switched this checkout from `recursive-e2e/stage-4` to this
workstream after pausing recursive E2E. This branch was then rebased onto
current remote `main` at `a72d0a8` before project-management work resumed.

## Current State

- The first portfolio checkpoint is recorded for 2026-08-15.
- Workstream intake was introduced on 2026-08-16 at the product owner's
  direction, as a second deliberate bootstrap exception: `project-management`
  published the `WORKFLOW.md` and `AGENTS.md` changes because handing the item
  to `workflow-improvements` required the very mechanism being defined. The
  four workstreams now have `intake/` directories, and the two checkpoint items
  that were never delivered on 2026-08-15 have been delivered, along with the
  product owner's commit-cadence and branch-synchronization proposal.
- A V1 readiness assessment is recorded for 2026-08-16. Its central finding is
  that V1 itself is untracked: the gap review defines four milestones, three of
  which appear in no other document and have no owning workstream. Defining V1
  precisely is therefore this workstream's next task.
- The minimal workflow improvements it identified are published in
  `WORKFLOW.md`: verified divergence resolution, the merge-landed check,
  and non-exclusive file editing with a handoff carve-out. This was a
  deliberate bootstrap exception, because `workflow-improvements` could not
  start cleanly without them.
- The second portfolio checkpoint is recorded for 2026-08-16. It sets release
  sequencing: v026 carries the self-contained entry point and the URL-open fix
  and is delegated to `recursive-e2e`; the contained display moves to v027; and
  bug vocabulary goes to `workflow-improvements`.
- v026 is complete and recommended on `main`. `recursive-e2e` is paused by the
  product owner as of 2026-08-18 after completing Stage 6; Stage 7 is its next
  task when resumed. Its widened registered goal remains accurate because it
  delivered product work as well as recursive-E2E evidence.
- `workflow-improvements` is paused as of 2026-08-17 with its intake
  dispositioned. `project-management` itself has seven pending intake items
  from that workstream; they have been read but not yet dispositioned.
- `project-management` is the standing home for cross-workstream priority,
  sequencing, dependency, and lifecycle decisions.
- No other workstream's task details or WIP documents have been moved here.

## Last Task And Status

Last task: record the second portfolio checkpoint, setting release sequencing
across v026 and v027 and delegating the work.

Status: complete. The
[2026-08-16 checkpoint](2026-08-16-portfolio-checkpoint.md) records three
decisions, delivers two handoffs through intake rather than announcing them,
corrects two stale registry facts about `recursive-e2e`, and widens that
workstream's registered goal so the registry no longer understates where product
work lives.

Preceding tasks, both complete: the
[V1 readiness assessment](2026-08-16-v1-readiness-assessment.md), which records
eight unowned shortcomings and seven documented items to pin to V1; and the
[first portfolio checkpoint](2026-08-15-portfolio-checkpoint.md).

## Next Resumable Task

Define V1. Until now V1 has been a target held in the product owner's head plus
a dated gap-review snapshot; the obvious prerequisites were clear, but the
release boundary is not. Complete the [V1 scope ledger](v1-scope-ledger.md),
which now holds six decided or proposed rows.

Start by settling the release thesis in *Open Threads* below. Roughly half the
remaining rows cannot be written without it, so beginning anywhere else produces
verdicts that may not survive the answer.

Done means:

- every gap in the V1 gap review carries a release verdict — in V1, deferred to
  a later release, or rejected — with the rejections and deferrals stated rather
  than left silent;
- every item retained for V1 names an owning workstream, and any milestone with
  no owning workstream is either registered as one or explicitly reassigned;
- the five functional scope decisions the gap review left open are decided, or
  carry a decision date and a named decider;
- V1 acceptance is stated as criteria that can be checked: which requirement
  records must reach `validated`, which open bugs block, and which documents
  must exist;
- the seven at-risk items in the readiness assessment each hold a single
  recorded home rather than several partial ones; and
- the ledger's cross-workstream consequences actually reach the affected
  workstream handoffs, given that the previous checkpoint's handoff to
  `workflow-improvements` never arrived in the document that workstream reads.

Record a further checkpoint only when the next cross-workstream priority,
sequence, dependency, or lifecycle decision becomes due. Checkpoints are
written because a decision is needed, not on a schedule.

## Deferred From This Workstream

Decide the release target for the file locking protocol in the
[coordination backlog](coordination-backlog.md), including whether ordinary Git
conflict resolution makes it unnecessary. Recording that it is unnecessary is a
valid outcome. This was the previously planned next task and is deliberately
sequenced behind defining V1, since the V1 boundary determines whether the
protocol is a release commitment at all.

## Open Threads

Written at pause on 2026-08-16 and re-read on resume on 2026-08-18. This is a
trial of the `Open Threads` shape
proposed to `workflow-improvements`; the format is not ratified, and structuring
this workstream's own handoff needs no protocol change. Kept deliberately short:
questions and reasoning hooks, not a transcript.

### Awaiting The Product Owner

1. **The release thesis.** Containment product — one IDE, boundary provable,
   agent-safety wedge — versus workspace product with multi-IDE breadth. Decides
   roughly half the unwritten ledger rows. Agent recommendation: containment,
   because it is where the project is ahead of the field rather than behind it.
2. **Java: inside the V1 window or immediately after.** Inside, it competes with
   concurrency and the entry point; after, it becomes the first post-V1
   milestone and gives the announcement a concrete next promise.
3. **Fourth agent, Case A.** Bring-your-own-endpoint is proposed `in-v1` and
   unratified. Case B, DevCapsule running the model, is proposed `deferred`.
4. **The twelve-week release shape**, carried as `proposed` in the ledger and
   never ratified — and now stale, because moving the contained display to v027
   removed a block the shape assumed was inside the window. It needs rebuilding
   before it can be ratified.
5. **Is the use-case set complete at two?** The learner/tinkerer and the serious
   solo developer. The agent offered to write the set up as a ledger section
   once complete; that remains undone.

### Weighed And Unresolved

- **Concurrency was chosen over VSCodium** for the extra four weeks, on the
  argument that a broken first ten minutes costs more than a narrower platform
  list. Not revisited since the v027 deferral changed the surrounding shape.
- **noVNC provisionally preferred over Xpra seamless mode**, with a spike to
  decide. Xpra is the option that actually fixes desktop integration; noVNC is
  the more predictable and more demo-friendly. Neither is committed.
- **Skeleton delivery mechanism undecided:** submodule, matching the existing
  sample convention, or in-tree, which avoids another publishable repository and
  the unreachable-pointer bug. Raised, not answered.
- **`recursive-e2e`'s widened goal** is a registry patch, not a settled shape.
  The alternative is registering a separate workstream for product work; that
  workstream may raise it back.
- **uid/gid across machines** is unverified. Whether formation identity and
  state layout survive a second developer with a different UID should be checked
  before "scales to multi-developer" is claimed anywhere.

### Deliberately Not Preserved

The conversation itself. Decisions are in the ledger and the two checkpoints,
and everything above is what would otherwise have been lost. Nothing else from
the 2026-08-16 session needs recovering to resume this workstream.

## External State And Risks

- Corrected 2026-08-15: this environment does have Git publication credentials
  and can push branches and unprotected `main`, and the local Docker CLI is
  authenticated to the registry. The earlier statement that a human must
  publish mainline commits was stale for at least two sessions and cost
  avoidable friction. Verify such constraints before relying on them.
- Refined 2026-08-16, so the correction above is not over-read. The `origin`
  remote is SSH, and that key authorizes Git transport only. There is no `gh`
  CLI and no `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so this environment cannot create,
  review, or merge a pull request; those are GitHub API objects. For any
  workstream whose delivery method is a pull request, an agent prepares and
  pushes the branch and the human opens and merges it. Installing and
  authenticating `gh` would remove that limit.
- The permanent lifecycle is a documented repository-local exception until
  the `workflow-improvements` workstream defines and validates the general
  rule.
- Project management must remain coordination rather than a path for bypassing
  branch ownership, integration policy, or another workstream's handoff.
