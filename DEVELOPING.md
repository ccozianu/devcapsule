# For developers

[Back to DevCapsule](README.md)

DevCapsule creates reproducible, resumable development environments for
humans and AI coding agents: a real IDE, agent-ready tooling, versioned
project memory, and explicit boundaries around access to the host. The
product is one Python distribution project in `devcapsule-src/`, shipped as
a single Linux executable. This page is the brief; each subject has its own
document under [`engineering-docs/development/`](engineering-docs/development/README.md).

## Developer Setup

```text
cd devcapsule-src
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e . --no-deps
.venv/bin/python -m nox -s build      # the full local gate, before any checkpoint
```

Setup, the gate's steps, building the executable, the shipped `devcapsule0`
versus the development `devcapsule`, and working from inside a capsule:
[Developer environment](engineering-docs/development/developer-environment.md).

## Source layout

### Python package boundaries

The repository's directories and the `devcapsule` package's responsibilities,
including the enforced configuration boundary:
[Source layout](engineering-docs/development/source-layout.md).

## Testing

| Suite | Command | Document |
|---|---|---|
| Unit tests, with coverage; what the hosted runner runs | `nox -s tests` | [Unit tests](engineering-docs/development/unit-tests.md) |
| Integration: the built executable, the CLI smoke, types, the docs contract | `nox -s integration`, inside `build` | [Integration tests](engineering-docs/development/integration-tests.md) |
| End-to-end, with Docker: images, capsules, the IDE smoke | `nox -s e2e`, `nox -s ide-smoke`, … | [End-to-end tests](engineering-docs/development/e2e-tests.md) |

The hosted runner runs no Docker; the end-to-end suites run locally and
against downloaded candidates during release acceptance.

## Releasing

Follow [Releasing a new DevCapsule version](engineering-docs/implementation-notes/devcapsule/2026-09-01-release-and-validation-process.md):
an immutable candidate from a retained release branch, validated as
downloaded, integrated with its acceptance record, tagged for final
publication; documentation and the website are part of the release.

## Website

Initialize the submodule with `git submodule update --init website`, then
`./scripts/website.sh install` and `./scripts/website.sh preview`. The site
has its own checks and publishing rules in
[`website/README.md`](website/README.md) and
[`website/PUBLISHING.md`](website/PUBLISHING.md); the documentation it
publishes follows the
[content–website contract](engineering-docs/specifications/product/content-website-contract.md).

## Development Principles

- Keep host filesystem, credentials, Docker, devices and networking exposure
  explicit and documented.
- Keep current behaviour in user documentation; preserve obsolete behaviour
  only as clearly labelled history.
- Store requirements, decisions, bugs, validation evidence and status in
  versioned files, never only in chat.
- Add automated, Nox-covered checks when practical; validate host Docker,
  image and GUI behaviour manually where automation cannot reach.

## Where to read next

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), mandatory instructions for coding agents, and
  [`WORKFLOW.md`](WORKFLOW.md) with [`WORKFLOW-LOCAL.md`](WORKFLOW-LOCAL.md),
  the human-agent protocol and this project's half of it.
- [`CURRENT-STATUS.md`](CURRENT-STATUS.md), the open-workstream list;
  this repository runs the workflow in `multiple-streams` mode.
- [`REQUIREMENTS.md`](REQUIREMENTS.md), the requirement overview, and
  [`engineering-docs/README.md`](engineering-docs/README.md), the placement
  rules for everything under `engineering-docs/`.
- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md), the product documentation, and
  [`index.md`](index.md), the complete documentation map.
- [`devcapsule-src/README.md`](devcapsule-src/README.md), the CLI source and
  contributor reference.
