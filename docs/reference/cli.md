# Command reference

Run `devcapsule COMMAND --help` on any command below to see its full argument
and option list. One exception: `devcapsule pycharm check-runtime` runs its
checks even when given `--help`.

`devcapsule project` commands discover the project from the current directory.
To target another directory, pass `--path` before the subcommand:
`devcapsule project --path PROJECT config show`. Inside a capsule, read-only
inspection commands use the capsule's captured launch view, while commands that
need host state print the exact `devcapsule` command to run outside.

## `devcapsule home`

`home` commands act on your [configuration home](../configuration/home.md) and
run from any directory without a project or `--path`. Set
`DEVCAPSULE_CONFIG_HOME` to select a separate self-contained home.

| Command | Intent |
|---|---|
| `show` | Show the home's path and source, format and minimum reader, defaults, and accepted channels. |
| `trust list` | List channels accepted in this home, with vendors, products, origins, and acceptance dates. |
| `trust accept CHANNEL [--yes]` | Show the channel and vendor terms, then ask for acceptance; `--yes` skips the prompt. |
| `trust withdraw CHANNEL` | Remove a channel's acceptance from this home; succeeds cleanly if it was not accepted. |
| `default memory\|cpus VALUE\|none` | Set a memory or CPU default for this home, or clear it with `none`. |

Inside a capsule, `show` and `trust list` read the launcher's settings mounted
read-only until you write a home setting inside the capsule. The first write
copies those settings into the capsule's own home without modifying the host's.

## `devcapsule project`

| Command | Intent |
|---|---|
| `init` | Create the project manifest and platform lock, record your checkout's IDE and capabilities, and resolve when an IDE is chosen. |
| `run` | Derive the launch plan from the project, this home, and this checkout, ask any open questions, and start the capsule. |
| `config` | Inspect what the next launch uses, change checkout choices or the shared project contract, and validate without launching. |
| `info` | Show selected software, container environment, and persistent storage paths without changing state. |
| `diagnose` | Capture a bounded health snapshot of a running or ended session, and optionally export a sanitized archive. |
| `list` | List checkouts registered in this home. |
| `checkout` | Manage this local checkout's name, notifications, and web-console decision documents. |
| `state` | Adopt an existing host directory into a checkout state slot. |
| `versions` | Check upstream freshness, preview and select checkout-local component versions, or roll back. |
| `recursive-e2e` | Run DevCapsule's own recursive validation harness (contributor tool). |

### `init`

```text
devcapsule project init [--require NAME[>=VERSION]]... [--offer CAPABILITY]... [--ide IDE] [--with CAPABILITY]...
                        [--name NAME] [--slug SLUG] [--creator CREATOR] [--project-mount PATH]
                        [--regenerate] [--unverified] [--set NAME VALUE]... [--authorize NAME VALUE]... [--bind NAME VALUE]...
```

`--require` and `--offer` write shared project capabilities into
`.devcapsule/devcapsule.toml` (schema 2) and generate the platform lock. Quote
`NAME>=VERSION` in your shell so `>` does not redirect output. `--ide` chooses
your IDE for this checkout (capability name such as `python-ide` or component
name such as `pycharm` or `vscode`), and repeatable `--with` adds personal
capabilities.

`--regenerate` rewrites the platform lock from the current embedded matrix and
migrates a schema-1 manifest to schema 2 while preserving its leading comments.
Schema-2 manifests cannot be read by candidate 3 or older launchers. When an
IDE is selected, `init` can ask for base or vendor consent; non-interactive
scripts can pass `--authorize NAME VALUE`. `--set`, `--bind`, and `--authorize`
also accept one optional justification argument after the value.

### `run`

```text
devcapsule project run [--ide IDE] [--with CAPABILITY]... [--use CAPABILITY=COMPONENT]... [--memory SIZE] [--cpus N] [--env NAME[=VALUE]]...
                       [--trust CHANNEL]... [--authorize NAME VALUE]... [--set NAME VALUE]... [--save]
                       [--name NAME] [--no-update-check] [--no-recursive-e2e] [--print-command] [--force] [-- DOCKER-RUN-OPTIONS...]
```

Flags for IDE, capabilities, providers, memory, CPUs, environment variables,
and host access apply to one launch unless you add `--save`. `--save` persists
those choices to the checkout record once review and plan validation succeed.
`--trust CHANNEL` records channel trust in this home without `--save`, provided
no required launch answer remains missing. `--set` on `run` accepts `memory`
(including a declared memory alias) and `cpus`; use `config set` for other
project-declared values.

`--ide IDE --force` launches an alternate IDE for one session when the project
requires a specific IDE. The launcher warns which required IDE is set aside,
records the departure in the launch plan, and leaves the manifest, shared lock,
and saved checkout IDE untouched. Plain `run` enforces the project requirement
again on the next launch. Consent, artifact verification, and dependency checks
still apply. `--force` is refused without `--ide`, with `--save`, when the
project requires no IDE, or when `--ide` already matches the required IDE, and
a forced session does not record a known-good configuration. See
[Capabilities and components](../configuration/capabilities.md#a-required-ide).

`--name` overrides the container name for one launch. `--no-update-check` skips
the daily channel check while keeping cached critical notices active.
`--no-recursive-e2e` disables recursive-validation readiness when running
DevCapsule on itself. Arguments after `--` pass straight to `docker run`,
except flags the launcher owns (`--network`, `--memory`, `--cpus`,
`--shm-size`, and managed mounts); conflicts fail with the DevCapsule flag or
command to use instead.

Without an interactive terminal, any unanswered required question stops launch
with exit status `3` and prints the flag or command that settles each item.
Unanswered host-access recommendations fall back to secure defaults for a plain
launch, whereas `config check` exits `3` until they are answered.

`--print-command` stops before starting a container and never saves checkout
answers, though it can still download components, build images, and populate
caches. Printed secret and environment values are redacted. Use `config show`
or `config check` when you want pure offline inspection.

## `devcapsule project config`

Read-only inspection (`--json` supported on all six):

| Command | Intent |
|---|---|
| `show` | Show every effective choice for the next launch, where it came from, and the command for any pending item. |
| `check [--manifest FILE --lock FILE]` | Validate configuration without writing or launching; exits `3` on the host when decisions are pending. With `--manifest` and `--lock`, checks only that candidate pair. |
| `env list` | List configured checkout environment variable names and sources without revealing values. |
| `docker-args list` | List saved `docker run` arguments with inline environment values masked. |
| `trust list` | List channels referenced by this checkout's lock alongside channels accepted in this home. |
| `console list` | List pending web-console configuration requests awaiting host confirmation. |

Checkout choices (stored outside the repository):

| Command | Intent |
|---|---|
| `ide [--unverified] IDE` | Set this checkout's IDE (`python-ide`, `frontend-ide`, `vscode-ide`, `java-ide`, `eclipse-ide`, `dotnet-ide`, or a component name such as `codium` or `vscode`). |
| `add [--unverified] CAPABILITY` | Add a personal capability not declared by the project. |
| `omit CAPABILITY` | Leave out an offered project capability or remove a personal addition. |
| `restore [--unverified] CAPABILITY` | Restore a previously omitted offered capability. |
| `use [--unverified] CAPABILITY COMPONENT\|default` | Pick a provider when several exist (such as `codium` or `vscode` for `frontend-ide`), or return to the project/catalog default. |
| `set NAME VALUE\|default` | Set `memory` (`6GiB`, `6g`), `cpus` (`4`), or a project-declared value; `default` clears your override. |
| `authorize NAME VALUE [JUSTIFICATION]` | Grant host access or per-checkout software consent; `--all-recommended` walks through project recommendations interactively. |
| `deny NAME` | Record an explicit host-access denial for this checkout. |
| `forget NAME` | Clear your recorded answer so the default applies or a recommendation asks again. |
| `approve [NAME...\|--all]` | List pending per-checkout software updates, or approve named updates (or `--all`). |
| `env set NAME [VALUE] [--from-host]` | Save a private variable value, prompt with hidden input when `VALUE` is omitted, or pass a host variable through at launch. |
| `env unset NAME` | Delete a saved or pass-through checkout environment entry. |
| `docker-args set -- OPTIONS...` | Replace this checkout's saved `docker run` options. |
| `docker-args clear` | Clear all saved `docker run` options. |
| `bind NAME PROVIDER:VALUE`, `unbind NAME` | Bind a declared state slot or secret input to a host directory or host environment variable, or return it to managed storage. |
| `console apply\|discard ID` | Apply a queued web-console request on the host, or discard it. |

Shared project contract (for repository owners; writes schema 2):

| Command | Intent |
|---|---|
| `require 'CAPABILITY[>=VERSION]'... [--because REASON]` | Require capabilities on every checkout, with an optional minimum version. |
| `require env NAME... [--because REASON]` | Declare required application environment variables; prompted hidden on first launch and stored per checkout. |
| `offer CAPABILITY... [--because REASON]`, `offer env NAME... [--because REASON]` | Offer optional capabilities or environment inputs that a checkout may omit or leave unset. |
| `drop [env] NAME...` | Remove a capability or environment requirement or offer. |
| `recommend CAPABILITY COMPONENT\|none` | Recommend a component provider (such as `vscode` or `codium` for `frontend-ide`), or clear it with `none`. |
| `recommend ide\|memory\|cpus VALUE [--because REASON]` | Set an ordinary project default that applies unless a checkout overrides it, or clear with `none`. |
| `recommend network\|docker-daemon\|development-sudo\|host-browser VALUE --because REASON` | Recommend wider host access with a reason so each developer is asked; `none` removes it. |

Every shared-contract command accepts `--preview` to validate and print the
resulting change without writing files. Capability changes and provider
recommendations update the manifest and platform lock together and accept
`--unverified` when needed; environment declarations and non-provider
recommendations update only `.devcapsule/devcapsule.toml`.

See [Vendor software and trust](../configuration/software-approvals.md) for
home trust vs. per-checkout consent, and
[Project versus personal](../configuration/project-versus-personal.md#from-the-console)
for confirming web-console requests.

See [Component upgrades](../updates/component-upgrades.md) for version-set workflows.

## Retired spellings

Removed configuration subcommands (`config list`, `config resolve`,
`config need`, `config agent`, `config tool`, mutating `project config default`
and `project config trust`) and retired `init`/`run` flags exit with status `2`,
write nothing, and print the replacement command on one line.
`project config capabilities --recover` remains available solely to repair an
interrupted manifest/lock write.
