# Linux

DevCapsule {{tag}} ships as a single executable for **64-bit Intel/AMD Linux
(`x86_64` / `linux-amd64`)**. You need:

- **Docker Engine with Buildx**, usable directly by your ordinary user account
  (never run `devcapsule` under `sudo`).
- **A modern web browser** to open the capsule's contained desktop and
  [web console](../sessions/web-console.md) on `127.0.0.1`.
- **`curl` and `sha256sum`** to download and verify the release executable,
  plus several gigabytes of free disk space for base and IDE image layers.

[Install](../getting-started/install.md) checks all of these in three commands.
ARM Linux (`aarch64` / `linux-arm64`) is not supported in {{tag}}.

DevCapsule is developed and tested on Ubuntu-family desktops using Docker
Engine from [Docker's official repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
Other current `x86_64` Linux distributions with a standard Docker Engine and
Buildx setup are expected to work without special flags; if yours hits a
platform-specific failure, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ccozianu/devcapsule/issues/new)
with your distribution, Docker version, and error output (omitting private
session URLs and tokens).
