# Build and select a local base

Every capsule image starts from a base image containing the operating system,
toolchains, contained display, and (from base recipe `11` onward) the web
console. Normally you run the published base pinned in the project's platform
lock. Building a base on your own computer lets one checkout run a newer recipe
before the project lock pins a published update—for example, when a checkout on
an older base prints:

```text
Web console: none on this base (ubuntu-24.04@9; the console needs base recipe 11 or later); the capsule runs without it.
  To build a base that has it:  devcapsule images build --type base --recipe ubuntu-24.04 --source-revision <revision>
  Then select it for this checkout; the steps: https://devcapsule.mycodespace.ai/docs/current/configuration/local-base/
```

The capsule still runs without a local base; follow these steps only when you
want the newer base recipe on your checkout right away.

## Build the base

`images build --type base` builds from the recipe embedded in your launcher and
records the launcher's source revision in image provenance labels. Read the
revision from `devcapsule version` (or copy the launcher's printed command) and
supply a local `--tag` name, which `images build --type base` requires:

```bash
devcapsule version
devcapsule images build --type base --recipe ubuntu-24.04 \
  --tag devcapsule-base-local:recipe-11 \
  --source-revision 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

Choose a `--tag` that makes the local image clear to you. The first build
installs OS packages and toolchains and takes several minutes. Add `--network
host` if your Docker BuildKit network cannot resolve DNS names. When running a
launcher built from unpublished or modified local source rather than a
downloaded release, pass `--allow-local-source` instead of
`--source-revision`.

Verify the built image and its provenance labels in your local Docker store:

```bash
devcapsule images list
```

`images list` reports the recipe (such as `ubuntu-24.04@11`) and the source
revision it was built from.

## Select it for a checkout

From the project checkout on your host:

```bash
devcapsule project config authorize base-image devcapsule-base-local:recipe-11
devcapsule project run
```

`authorize base-image` inspects the local image, verifies that it is a
DevCapsule base image for your platform, records its exact image ID in this
checkout's configuration, and notes that your selection overrides the lock's
published base for this checkout. The next `project run` materializes the
checkout's environment image on top of that local base (printing the web
console link when the base is recipe `11` or newer).

Keep these boundaries in mind:

- **Personal to this checkout:** the override stays in your checkout record
  ([Project versus personal](project-versus-personal.md)); the shared lock in
  Git still pins the published base for everyone else.
- **Bound to the exact image ID:** if you rebuild the base under the same tag,
  run `project config authorize base-image <tag>` again to bind the new ID.
- **Qualification, not shared validation:** running on a local base tests your
  checkout on that recipe, and any lock proposal generated from such a checkout
  notes the local-base qualification.
- **Does not waive project requirements:** a local base cannot bypass mandatory
  project guarantees such as a capability minimum; see [Capabilities and
  components](capabilities.md).

`devcapsule project config show` lists the active `base-image` override among
your checkout's answers.

## Back to the published base

```bash
devcapsule project config authorize base-image default
```

`default` returns this checkout to the base pinned in the project lock (covered
either by that exact digest or by your home's `devcapsule-base` channel trust).
The local base image stays in your Docker store until you remove it with
`docker rmi`.
