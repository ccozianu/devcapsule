description: How text moves between your computer and the capsule's desktop, how keys and fullscreen behave in the browser tab, and how links open.

# Clipboard, keys and browser

The capsule's desktop runs inside a browser tab on `127.0.0.1` so your host
display session stays outside the container. That isolation changes three
everyday habits: copying text across the boundary, entering fullscreen, and
opening external links.

## Clipboard

The capsule cannot read your computer's clipboard automatically; text crosses
only when you move it:

1. Open the control bar along the left edge of the desktop tab and select the
   **Clipboard** icon.
2. **From capsule to host:** copy text inside the IDE (`Ctrl+C`), then copy it
   out of the sidebar's clipboard box into your host clipboard.
3. **From host to capsule:** paste text into the sidebar's clipboard box, then
   paste inside the IDE (`Ctrl+V` or `Ctrl+Shift+V` in terminals).

Keeping clipboard transfer explicit prevents background processes inside the
capsule from reading secrets you copied on your host.

## Keys, Escape and fullscreen

In a normal browser tab, every shortcut the browser itself does not reserve
reaches the IDE—including `Escape`.

- **Use your browser's fullscreen (`F11`), not the sidebar's fullscreen
  button.** Browsers exit HTML5 element fullscreen whenever you press `Escape`,
  which intercepts `Escape` before Vim modes, dialogs, or code completion see
  it. Instead, press `Ctrl+L` to focus the address bar, press `F11` (or
  **View → Enter Full Screen** on macOS), and click back into the desktop.
- Browser-reserved shortcuts such as `Ctrl+W`, `Ctrl+T`, and `Alt+Tab` stay with
  your browser and OS. If you close the tab with `Ctrl+W` by mistake, the
  capsule keeps running—reopen the desktop URL printed in your launcher
  terminal ([Stop and come back](../getting-started/stop-and-come-back.md)).

## Managing windows on the capsule desktop

The capsule runs a single virtual desktop with a taskbar along the bottom
showing a button for every open window and a clock. The IDE starts maximized
and resizes automatically when you resize the browser window. If a modal dialog
or secondary window opens behind the main editor, click its button on the
bottom panel—or right-click empty desktop background—to bring it forward.

## Opening links on your host browser

No web browser is installed inside the default base image unless a project adds
`browser-automation`. When an IDE or CLI agent prints or opens an `http://` or
`https://` link (such as OAuth sign-in or API documentation), you have two
choices:

- **Copy the URL out** through the left sidebar's clipboard box and open it in
  your host browser, or
- **Grant the URL-only browser broker** for this checkout (or a single run):

  ```bash
  devcapsule project config authorize host-browser true
  # or for one session without saving:
  devcapsule project run --authorize host-browser true
  ```

With `host-browser` enabled, `http://` and `https://` URLs opened through
`BROWSER` / `xdg-open` inside the capsule ask the launcher on your host to open
them in your default browser, without exposing your browser profile or display
session to the container. Withdraw it anytime with `devcapsule project config
deny host-browser` ([Granting and withdrawing
access](../containment/granting-and-withdrawing.md)).
