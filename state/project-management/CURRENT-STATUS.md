# Workstream Current Status: Project Management

Mnemonic: `project-management`

Start date: 2026-08-09

State: active 2026-10-29; reviewing 0.3.0 completion; the October 25 documentation proposals move to 0.3.1 by owner decision

Definition read: WORKFLOW.md@8976f8d5f8f0, WORKFLOW-LOCAL.md@31819cc43359

Branch association: `ws-project-management/coordination`

Integration target: `main`

Delivery method: pull request for deliverables; records published on coordination

Requirements: `R-PRODUCT-003`, `R-PRODUCT-005`, `R-PRODUCT-006`

## Goal

Own project-wide priorities, sequencing, dependencies and lifecycle decisions.
This reserved workstream remains open for the lifetime of multiple-stream mode.
The immutable start date and adoption exception remain in the workstream list.

## Current State

### Resumed 2026-10-29: release scope and documentation deferral

The owner moved the October 25 documentation proposals to **0.3.1**.
The [scope decision's amendment](2026-10-27-decision-release-0-3-0-scope-at-rc8.md#amendment-october-25-documentation-proposals-move-to-031)
records the boundary: the separate language review and accurate candidate
documentation remain 0.3.0 obligations. Maintenance retains the deferred
work order. Glossary and recipes stay accepted for 0.3.1; the other nine
September 28 proposal decisions remain open.

Remote state checked on 2026-10-29: `main` at `6e509e2d`, release branch
at `7545a536`, latest candidate RC8. PRs #293 (diagnostics), #294 (C20),
#299 (configuration home) and #301 (VS Code) are merged into the release
branch and await a later candidate. C17, remaining documentation decisions,
language review and downloaded-candidate acceptance remain open. The
October 27 decision already moved image/cache cleanup out of 0.3.0.

Synchronized this branch with `origin/main` because the workflow rules
changed. Read those changes; preserved the IDE and submodule contents.
No open bug on the checked release tree is owned by project-management.
Took the October 28 agent-run-supervision mail into intake; it remains
pending and its product work is explicitly outside 0.3.0.

Delivered `2026-10-29-project-management-october25-docs-to-031.md` to
maintenance at coordination `ed0b3f1cd0da`. Its acknowledgement and the
release-branch record updates remain with maintenance.

The dated accounts below preserve earlier decisions; use the October 27
scope decision and its October 29 amendment for current release planning.

### Earlier coordination account

The owner confirmed the proposed 23 dispositions on 2026-10-09, then directed
closure of the obsolete Stage 7 resource-convention request with no action.
The owner then prioritized the separate persistent-diagnostics request for
active implementation planning, targeted ready for 0.3.0. On 2026-10-10 the owner postponed agenda items 7, 8 and 12 until before V1,
tentatively 0.9, explicitly outside 0.3.0. The owner also dropped Pagefind catalog inclusion and required a portable
website dependency handoff. Thirty messages are closed in the same commit as their appended log entries: 29 acknowledgements and one dropped
request. Eight original messages remain undecided; one new testing-policy
reconciliation message is received and pending separately.
Closing an intake does not complete retained implementation or acceptance work.

The next release is **0.3.0**, by the owner's unconditional 2026-10-05
ruling. Current planning uses that name. Historical references and the source
version 0.2.16.dev0 remain unchanged. Scope, driver and cut still need decisions.
The [current proposal](2026-09-27-0216-release-planning.md) separates accepted
commitments from proposals; its historical filename is retained.

### Pause: Road To The First 0.3.0 Candidate

Owner direction, 2026-10-11: pause planning here. The purpose of the session is
to identify the distance to an RC and shorten it. The owner directed consent/
vendor trust (#1) and forced-configuration preview/launch (#6) first, with the
remaining release work handled in the RC cycle. No implementation workstream
was selected in this checkout and no release cut was authorized.

The [release plan](2026-09-27-0216-release-planning.md#owners-sequence-before-pausing-2026-10-11)
records the concrete scope. The network item is the existing authorization
command working without a recommendation. The terminal item is harmless
launch noise and a Ctrl+C traceback. The normal Docker-build optimization
is delivered; only empty-cache reuse and obsolete-image/cache cleanup remain.
Diagnostics logging/rotation is merged; assess what is still needed from
snapshot/export and browser evidence.

The agent agreed with the sequence and flagged the remaining image and
diagnostics scope as potentially substantial. The owner has not decided a
reduction or deferral; retain that question without inventing another gate.
The eleven user-docs decisions, release driver and final cut criteria remain.
Use plain descriptions when presenting the work, as the owner requested.
Delivered `2026-10-11-project-management-pre-rc-sequence.md` to
component-upgrades and maintenance at coordination `a495e67a9428` so both
implementation owners have the sequence and its open scope qualifications.

### Latest Decision: Project Operations Now, Bootstrap At 0.9

Owner decision, 2026-10-11: ecosystem-aware project bootstrap moves from
0.3.0 to 0.9, dependent on project-type templating. Project tools should be on
PATH throughout the capsule by default; exceptional project types may require
`devcapsule project shell` to activate them. The examples include Java/Maven,
Scala/sbt, Python/nox, Node/npm and Node/Yarn. The [complete decision](2026-10-11-decision-project-operations-and-bootstrap.md)
preserves the scope and the distinction from earlier agenda item 7.

For 0.3.0, the agent must know how to build, run each test tier and selective
tests, run the default program, debug it, and explain debugger attachment.
WORKFLOW.md must require this continuing responsibility. WORKFLOW-LOCAL.md
must hold each project's actual instructions, established and maintained with
the human even when all execution is delegated to the agent. This is assigned
to workflow-improvements; the testing-policy intake remains separately undecided.

Delivered the full decision to maintenance as
`2026-10-11-project-management-bootstrap-target-09.md` at coordination
`133a049ad96e`, and to workflow-improvements as
`2026-10-11-project-management-project-operation-instructions-030.md` at
`c878496a5533`. Maintenance owns updating the canonical bug and its plate;
workflow-improvements owns rule implementation. Neither recipient's source or
status file was edited here. The new rule and shell command are not claimed
implemented. The templating dependency's implementation owner remains open
for 0.9 planning.

### Reasons for closing the 23 messages

| Messages | Decision and evidence |
|---|---|
| Blog establishment and review (2) | Local blog rules, the repository blog and website publication mechanism exist. The broken PUBLISHING.md link is resolved. Optional editorial suggestions are not outstanding obligations. |
| Display delivery (1) | v0.2.12 acceptance and the delivery notice establish the contained desktop; the V1 ledger is ratified. Display follow-ups remain separate. |
| Maintenance ownership (1) | Workflow and runbook already assign maintenance releases and bug triage; no repeated owner decision is needed. |
| Branch migration (3) and definition notice (1) | Active workstream rows use ws-prefixed branches; this workstream publishes to coordination, has no old outbox ref and has read the current definition. The old deadlines and instructions are historical. |
| Configuration decisions, assignment and delivery (3) | R-CONFIG-001 and PR #170 at 6ae1a01 establish the accepted contract and integration. Rollout and recovery limits remain; integration does not prove host restart. |
| IntelliJ/Playwright delivery (1) | PR #170 integrated the slice. The separate Playwright host-restart acceptance condition remains with component-catalog. |
| Release rename (1) | Owner ruling fixes 0.3.0 unconditionally, without choosing the driver or cut. |
| Configuration presentation (2) | Both owner rulings are accepted: recorded schema controls listing; pinned, newer and overridden base choices must be clear. Retained in the coordination backlog for the upgrade design, not claimed implemented. |
| First-session UX (1) | New base naming covers the old RC-label complaint; maintenance's published 0.3.0 plate retains terminal presentation and normal Ctrl+C handling. |
| Status reliability (1) | Accepted R-UPGRADE-002 already belongs to component-upgrades; preserve wanted V1 work and operational choices without adding a gate. |
| Legacy capabilities (1) and user-docs proposals (1) | The owner already mandated these decision gates. The ledger and release proposal preserve them; their individual product choices remain open. |
| Release notes (1) | Notes, backfill and runbook obligations are adopted; maintenance's 0.3.0 plate retains automation. |
| Consent (1) | The owner explicitly assigned D-0011 through D-0013 to the next release, now 0.3.0. Do not ask whether it is in scope again. |
| IDE files (1) | The repository ignore policy is decided. Project-management retains execution without deleting local files; no IDE edits are included in this reconciliation. |
| Forced configuration (1) | Maintenance holds the accepted behavior. Exact interface and mandatory-guarantee reconciliation remain design work, not an unresolved adoption vote. |

### Obsolete Stage 7 request closed

The owner identified the old plan as out of sync with development and directed
its closure. The 2026-09-21 forwarded convention request itself confirms that
Stage 7 was dissolved on 2026-08-27 and explicitly retired on 2026-09-21.
It is dropped with no task, reminder or new workstream. Existing maintenance
bugs and any retained-resource constraints are separate and unchanged.

The previous grouping with persistent diagnostics was misleading. That proposal
arose from the owner's 2026-10-08 noVNC disconnect and requests persistent,
bounded logs. The owner clarified that it is urgent and must enter active
implementation planning targeted ready for 0.3.0. Its intake is acknowledged;
the complete proposal is preserved in the [assigned work order](../../work-orders/2026-10-08-persistent-session-diagnostics.md).
Candidate C21 is active, priority wanted. The owner assigned implementation to
maintenance on 2026-10-11: reliable logs are a prerequisite for maintenance to
diagnose and fix failures. Maintenance owns the needed supervisor/display,
launcher and IDE logging work, scopes the bounded release slice and acceptance,
and coordinates the existing C10 terminal/shutdown work. Ownership does not
wait on contained-display's lifecycle. Detailed engineering recommendations
remain subject to scoping; no implementation completion is claimed.

Delivered the complete work order to maintenance as
`2026-10-11-project-management-maintenance-persistent-diagnostics.md` at
coordination `a535ccf3a44e`. Maintenance acknowledged it. A fresh main fetch
verified the logging/rotation stack merged through PR #209 at 26fdc6a;
snapshot/export and browser evidence remain in its published plan. Older
acceptance evidence does not automatically establish the later rotation design.

### Pagefind catalog proposal closed; website handoff delivered

Owner direction, 2026-10-10: Pagefind belongs in the website's npm dependencies
when search is implemented. The /opt/xtras installation was a temporary
experiment, not a portable build prerequisite. Current package.json and build
script inspection found no Pagefind integration; this is not a claim of an
existing production dependency. Playwright's delivered component is separate.

Delivered `2026-10-10-project-management-pagefind-project-dependency.md` to
website at coordination `5b05eeecda11`. The handoff asks that website record
this in its independent project's W10 work: pinned npm devDependency and
lockfile, project-local build invocation, generated static assets, and a
fresh-checkout build/browser check without global Pagefind or /opt/xtras.
Indexing must preserve the build's atomic publication behavior. No new search
schedule or implementation was authorized. The original combined intake is
closed; implementation and acknowledgement of this new handoff belong to website.

### Retained work and when to revisit it

The [coordination backlog](coordination-backlog.md#accepted-work-retained-after-intake-closure)
records the accepted configuration-presentation, reliability and IDE-file work.
The release proposal records 0.3.0 obligations, and the V1 ledger records the
legacy-capability gate. These are the homes of the work; the intake log is the
receipt. Do not duplicate those receipts as questions on every resumption.
A later priority must not weaken either existing release gate.

Delivered the configuration-presentation requirements and confirmed consent/
reliability commitments to component-upgrades as
`2026-10-09-project-management-accepted-upgrade-followups.md` at coordination
`387656fed15e`. No implementation priority or new release gate was assigned.

The seven-item Karpathy list remains closed. The console work order remains
with capsule-webconsole in its separate checkout. Main includes subsequent
console integrations through PR #201; the earlier published second-iteration
handoff is historical. This reconciliation does not claim owner acceptance
of further console work.

## Planned Next Step

Continue the 0.3.0 review with the remaining nine documentation proposal
decisions, the separate language review, C17 and candidate acceptance.
Check maintenance's acknowledgement of the October 25 work order's move
to 0.3.1. Recheck remote delivery before presenting outstanding work;
published summaries still describe several merged slices as awaiting merge.

Items 7 (mycodespace/checkout naming), 8 (OpenCode evaluation) and 12 (routine
documentation cleanup) are recorded in the [pre-V1 backlog](coordination-backlog.md#pre-v1-work-tentatively-09-excluded-from-030).
They are explicitly outside 0.3.0. Revisit at 0.9 or the final pre-V1 planning
cycle, whichever comes first; do not raise them during ordinary 0.3.0 planning.

The eight remaining intake messages form the following groups, not another
38-item review after the older agenda:

| Group | Messages | Remaining work |
|---|---:|---|
| Upgrade design | 3 | Experience, automated component validation and claims from experiments; one design discussion. |
| Configuration and recovery | 3 | init/config boundary, internal generation vocabulary and launcher-bootstrap recovery; reconcile with the newer contract first. |
| Product direction | 2 | Two adopter/blog inputs; separate delivered positioning from unsettled choices. mycodespace/checkout naming is in the pre-V1 backlog. |

Do not implement or disposition these eight under the earlier approvals.
The [prior handoff](2026-10-09-record-before-intake-reconciliation.md) preserves
older context, including the lifecycle question for contained-display and
sample-projects. Neither lack of a live publication nor this cleanup closes them.

## Validation And External State

Pause checkpoint: records only; the prior full gate for 71f1fde remains the
validation baseline because executable inputs have not changed. Handoff links and
whitespace passed for this update; both recipient copies match the sent item.
The pause mail take returned no items. Main synchronization remains
deferred for the same records-only reason below. Existing .idea edits are
preserved outside the PM commits. No transcript is created.


For this records-only scope checkpoint, main is at 61396e8. Its newer changes
do not touch the selected PM records or change WORKFLOW.md/WORKFLOW-LOCAL.md.
Synchronization is deferred to the next implementation boundary; no source or
other workstream's records are edited. Mail was empty at entry. No new project-
management bug or intake disposition is created by the owner's direct decision.
The scope checkpoint's full build gate passed: 1,498 runtime tests, 17
packaged integration tests and 290 web-console tests, plus type, syntax,
smoke and documentation-contract checks. The runtime suite retained one
xfail and one XPASS, with 35 deselected. Changed-document links and whitespace
passed; both delivered items byte-match the prepared decisions. The final
mail take returned no items. No container or service was started.


The approved records were committed and pushed as 9139717 after the initial
main merge 263f5d0. The checkpoint then merged origin/main at 435d3d4;
its only conflict was the root workstream list. Resolution preserves the
current project-management row and main's rows for every other workstream.
The new workflow topic 8.8 on human decision handoffs and the accompanying
AGENTS.md instruction have been read. No product decision changed in the merge.
The updated local gate includes the separate web-console session. No mailbox
items waited at the reconciliation entry and no open bug is owned by
project-management. On 2026-10-11 one new item was taken into intake:
`2026-10-10-capsule-webconsole-reconcile-testing-approach-with-practice.md`.
It is additional to the eight original intake items and remains undecided.
It asks for a project-wide testing-policy reconciliation; no policy change or
release target is inferred from receipt.
The known manifest/definition version mismatch is unchanged; this records pass
does not refresh the workflow or edit project configuration.

The required build gate passed again after merging main at 435d3d4:
1,498 runtime tests, 35 deselected, one xfail and one XPASS; all 17 packaged
integration tests, type checks, syntax, source/PEX smokes and the 184-page
documentation contract passed. The separate web-console session passed its
type check and 290 tests. Both nox sessions succeeded in about three minutes.
No container or service was started. The dirty-tree validation artifact is
`dist/devcapsule-local.pex`; this checkpoint does not produce a release artifact.
The final mailbox check found no waiting mail.
Record checks establish exactly 30 deletions and unique appended dispositions
(29 acknowledgements and one drop), eight byte-identical remaining messages, the
diagnostics proposal retained with the owner's subsequent assignment, both historical records preserved verbatim,
resolved links in changed documents and only this workstream's list row edited.
A pre-existing broken ledger link was corrected to its current engineering home.

The owner identified the current session as GPT-6 Astra on 2026-10-11.
Commits retain the human author and credit GPT-6 Astra Codex. This is a
session-specific attribution, not a model default for future sessions.
Pre-existing or IDE-generated .idea edits remain outside the checkpoint.
The selected workstream has not changed.
The owner requested regular commits and pushes on 2026-10-11. Checkpoint each
completed decision batch instead of accumulating several batches uncommitted.

## Resumed 2026-10-13

Synchronized with `main` by merge at `5dc95e9`; the definition is
unchanged since the last read; no mail waited. Delivered work rechecked
against the pull requests and the published states before any list was
presented, as the suspension note asked:

- The web console's second iteration is on `main` in full: PRs #192 to
  #206, each with its Codex review merged. Deliverables 1 to 5 and slice 8
  are delivered; deliverable 6, materialized views, is the third iteration
  and is not started.
- Persistent diagnostics, C21: slices 1 and 2 are on `main`, PRs #207 and
  #209 with reviews #208 and #210 to #212. Every component's log file, a
  WARNING baseline with lifecycle events, in-process rotation at an exact
  segment, one budget knob, the session manifest. Remaining: the snapshot
  and export command, browser evidence, and the Ctrl+C result shared with
  C10.
- Maintenance's plate: named build contexts (C5), the in-capsule project
  commands (C8) and the fresh-workspace test are on `main`. Not started:
  forced configuration (`resolve --force`, `run --force-config`), the
  universal network node, C10, C20.
- component-upgrades' consent slice: not started; the workstream is paused
  since 2026-10-02 with the design fully ruled.
- The trading-research sample project opened a `cli-engines` workstream on
  2026-10-13 from this checkout at the owner's word, then the owner struck
  the instruction as not meant for that session; that project's own
  project-management has since routed input to it. Whether to remove it is
  the owner's call, asked and pending.

The decision agenda handed to the owner in chat on 2026-10-13, in the
owner's own order: start of the two substantial implementations; the
0.3.0 scope, headline, driver and cut trigger with the console's delivered
state known; the eleven user-docs proposals; the upgrade-design slice; the
RC bound for the diagnostics remainder and image reuse and cleanup. The
launcher-recovery reconciliation with R-CONFIG-001 is agent work and is
offered, not asked.

## 2026-10-16: The SEO Objective Packaged For 0.9.x

Owner decision of 2026-10-16: the SEO items are not worked now. The website
repository's social-metadata work order stays open on the site's own clock;
the remaining items, the unindexed pages, the versioned twins' canonical
policy, the producer's marker and R-DOCS-003 amendment, search intent per
entry page, measurement and off-site presence, are item 13 of the
[pre-V1 backlog](coordination-backlog.md#item-13-search-discoverability-the-rest-of-the-seo-objective),
tentatively 0.9, with no implementation owner until pickup. The
competitive comparison review landed as PR #218 on 2026-10-16.

Later the same day the website delivered the whole social-metadata work
order, slices 1 to 4, at its commit `5dbfe49`. The producer's half is
[PR #219](https://github.com/ccozianu/devcapsule/pull/219) from
`ws-project-management/social-identity`: the `website:social` marker in
`README.md`, the additive amendment to R-DOCS-003, and the website pin
moved to the delivering commit. `nox -s docs-contract` passed and the local
render shows the landing page with the marker's title, the description,
the default card and the structured data. Item 13.3 of the pre-V1 backlog
is therefore done ahead of 0.9; the rest of item 13 stands. The live site
shows the change after the owner's next publication.

## 2026-10-18: The Competitive Comparison For Publication

Reviewed section by section with the owner from 2026-10-16 to 2026-10-18,
in the agreed tone: honest, not self-flagellating, each shortcoming linked
to its roadmap item. Five pre-V1 items were opened along the way, 14 to 18:
desktop-platform friction, the catalog ceiling with contributed and
federated components and the components position, the workflow toward
state-of-the-art practice, review and approve the software entering the
capsule, and credentials on the host behind an authenticating proxy, with
open-source candidates named for evaluation. The comparison and a journal
copy with a foreword and the owner's TL;DR are PR #221 against `main`; the
entry carries no draft flag and publishes with the next website
publication. The matrix's memory row and the host-environment column were
left as they are, by the owner's word that the document is good as is.

## 2026-10-18: Release 0.3.0 Scoped And Cut

The owner decided after the inventory of unimplemented plan items: cut
now, `maintenance` drives, six items are implemented during the candidate
cycle as dogfooding, consent and three others are out. Recorded in
[the decision](2026-10-18-decision-release-0-3-0-scope-and-cut.md), carried
to the driver by [the release work order](../../work-orders/2026-10-18-release-0-3-0.md),
delivered by mail the same day. The proposal's decisions 1 and 5 are
settled; 2, 3 and 4 stand as gates of the cycle.

## 2026-10-24: The CLI UX Redesign Work Order

While testing candidate 3 the owner asked for a challenge of the command
surface's assumptions, then for a work order: the deficiencies, the
principles as the owner ruled them on 2026-10-24, the config and run
experience addressed to the user, and the decisions still open. The
manifest a capable agent wrote for `ai-learning-bootstrap` on 2026-10-22
is part of the evidence: it expresses one of the project's three needs.
The draft is
[the work order](../../work-orders/2026-10-24-cli-ux-redesign.md); the
owner accepted the draft's last iteration and directed, the same day, that
it go through the review-partner loop with the Codex, gpt-6-astra pair.
Nothing in it is implemented; the owner named 0.3.0 rc4 as its release on
2026-10-24, answering Part 5 item 8; Part 5 lists
the eleven decisions for the owner.

The loop, topic 9.11: the slice is the document itself, PRn on
`ws-project-management/cli-ux-work-order` against `main`; the brief and
any round brief are under
[`evidence/2026-10-24-cli-ux-work-order/`](evidence/2026-10-24-cli-ux-work-order/).
Rounds and outcome: PR258 is #258; the Codex gpt-6-astra pair opened
PR258.1 as #259 at `bc3bf9b`, reproducing items 1 to 23 with 67 CLI
invocations and no container. Its findings held: Node was declarable with
`capabilities --required node` and the draft said the opposite; the lock
carries no workflow table; the bootstrap writer uses bare keys; the
transcript's IDE pins and the console on recipe 9 were wrong; two further
first-day gaps, a policy `init` that leaves the owner unable to run and a
`config list` that writes a placeholder; Part 5 grown from eleven to
twenty-four questions, item 24 catching a conflict between section 3.2 and
principle 1. One round, on the review's notes interleaved in Part 3, which
the owner had asked to be written to the user; moved into Part 5 at
`30ecdca`. Accepted and merged at `eab9ed6`. PR258 awaits the owner.

## Open Threads

- Current, 2026-10-29: the nine remaining documentation proposal decisions,
  the language-review assignment, C17 and candidate acceptance are open.
  The October 25 work order is deferred to 0.3.1, not cancelled.
  The new agent-run-supervision intake remains pending, outside 0.3.0.
  Older unresolved statements below must be read against the current scope
  decision; no transcript, implementation experiment or reminder was created.

- The CLI UX redesign work order awaits the owner's decisions, Part 5,
  items 1 to 11, after the review loop settles. The specification and the
  implementation are two later work orders, in 0.3.0 rc4 by the owner's
  answer to item 8.

- Awaiting the human: the eleven user-docs proposal decisions, a gate of the
  0.3.0 cycle; the image-cleanup design review when maintenance reaches it.
  The RC scope, driver and cut are decided as of 2026-10-18. The eight original intake messages and the new testing-policy
  reconciliation remain undecided. Consent and forced configuration go first;
  no additional deferral was agreed.
- Suspension point: planning paused deliberately. Recheck implementation
  progress before presenting the remaining list; several broad labels hid
  delivered work or small fixes. Do not restart the intake disposition exercise.
- Weighed and unresolved: the older local GitHub UI-only rule versus scoped gh
  grants, workflow-rule stewardship, and timing of humane-view dependencies.
  These are preserved context, not questions to repeat during unrelated work.
- Deliberately not preserved: no transcript, new feature experiment or automatic
  reminder service. Historical handoff and release proposal are retained verbatim.

## Workstream Document Index

- [Scope rechecked at RC8, amended October 29](2026-10-27-decision-release-0-3-0-scope-at-rc8.md): current release scope, including the October 25 documentation work deferred to 0.3.1.

- [Release 0.3.0: scope, driver and cut](2026-10-18-decision-release-0-3-0-scope-and-cut.md): the owner's decision of 2026-10-18; open when a scope question returns.
- [Release 0.3.0 work order](../../work-orders/2026-10-18-release-0-3-0.md): what the driver delivers and the gates before the final tag.
- [Project operations for 0.3.0; ecosystem bootstrap for 0.9](2026-10-11-decision-project-operations-and-bootstrap.md): accepted owner decision, default PATH and exceptional project shell direction, and continuing agent responsibility for project instructions.

- [Persistent session diagnostics work order](../../work-orders/2026-10-08-persistent-session-diagnostics.md): C21 assigned to maintenance on 2026-10-11, targeted ready for 0.3.0; bounded scope and acceptance remain.

- [Handoff before intake reconciliation](2026-10-09-record-before-intake-reconciliation.md): verbatim historical status; read for prior decisions and open-thread context.
- [Prior release proposal](2026-10-09-record-prior-release-proposal.md): verbatim 0.2.16-era proposal before the 0.3.0 reconciliation; historical recommendations, not current scope.

- [Work order: the website from the visitor's chair](../../work-orders/2026-09-28-website-visitor-experience.md) and [work order: visitor content and producer migration](../../work-orders/2026-09-28-visitor-content-and-producer-migration.md): issued 2026-09-28.
- [The content–website contract, version 1](../../specifications/product/content-website-contract.md): accepted 2026-09-28, promoted to the specifications on 2026-09-30; the website's `CONTRACT.md` is the authoritative text.
